📝Note #3:<br>
Hello to everyone & myself! It's been almost two weeks since last update. Got busy instructing the worker who installed the AC unit(not my room :<). Anyways hopefully I'll constantly code for now on. Also now I realize that using simply just header() & href to redirect is very impractical when its pushed on the web. So I'll be dumpster diving a lightweight routing library and learn it. Also my current custom crud will soon be replaced by medoo so thats some progress-ish.
<br>🛠v0.021 
<br>- Major folder/code restructure update

📝Note #4:<br>
Well this is kinda hectic well for my lazy side, been having problem transfering existing pdo database shenanigans to medoo's own shenanigans. Let's just say its kind of a disaster. I'll be reverting back to vanilla pdo instead of medoo which will took me another week of rewriting.
<br>🛠v0.022 
<br>- Re-coding/verting back to PDO instead of medoo/catfan on database management
